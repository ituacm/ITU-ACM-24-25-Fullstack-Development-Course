# MERN Stack Fullstack Development Course

This repository contains a curriculum designed to guide you through your journey in fullstack development provided by ITUACM DevTeam. We will develop a fully functional fullstack application using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) during the course. Throughout the project, we will store user data in the backend and display and manipulate this data on the frontend.

### Setup

Before starting the project, please install the following tools:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

### Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd mern-fullstack-course
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Project

To run the backend and frontend, open two separate terminals and execute the following commands:

1. **Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

Once both services are running, you can access the application's frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
